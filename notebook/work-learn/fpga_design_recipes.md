part1:概述

1. FPGAs,verilog,design flow
2. Applications:key design problems facing designers are worked through from start to fnish in a practical way. And how the designer can interpret a specifcation, develop a top-down design methodology and eventually build in detailed design blocks.
3. How to implement a particular function. A toolbox of advanced specifc functions that are commonly required in modern digital design.
4. The important aspect of design optimization, that is, how can I make my design faster, or more compact? 
5. The details of fundamental issues that are implemented in VHDL and Verilog.
